### 🎯 Goal

The main objetive of this project is to explore the relationship between demographic/location factors and online food ordering behaviour, analyse customer feedback to improve service quality, and predict customer preferences and behaviour based on demographic and location attributes.

### 📁 Dataset

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sudarshan24byte/online-food-dataset/data

The dataset contains information collected from an online food ordering platform over a period of time. Attributes included:

**- Age:** Age of the customer.
**-Gender:** Gender of the customer.
**-Marital Status:** Marital status of the customer.
**-Occupation:** Occupation of the customer.
**-Monthly Income:** Monthly income of the customer.
**-Educational Qualifications:** Educational qualifications of the customer.
**-Family Size:** Number of individuals in the customer's family.
**-Latitude:** Latitude of the customer's location.
**-Longitude:** Longitude of the customer's location.
**-Pin Code:** Pin code of the customer's location.
**-Output:** Current status of the order (e.g., pending, confirmed, delivered).
**-Feedback:** Feedback provided by the customer after receiving the order.

### 📋 Project phases

* ##### <u>**Phase 1: 🔎 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:</u>

Initial understanding of the data, identifying patterns, and preparing the data for further analysis. This includes data cleaning, outlier detection, and descriptive analysis.

* ##### <u>**Phase 2: 🔄 Data Transformation**:</u>

Processing data to enhance its quality and usability, including:

- Correcting typographical errors.
- Converting data types.
- Normalisation and standardisation.
- Removing duplicates and inconsistent values.

* ##### <u>**Phase 3: 📈 Data Visualisation - Python & Power BI**:</u>

Analysis of demographic attributes (e.g., Age, Gender, Marital Status) using summary statistics and visualisations to uncover trends in customer profiles.

Mapping Latitude and Longitude, for location data, to visualise geographical distribution and analyse trends by Pin Code. 

Exploration of the distribution and relationships of "Output" and "Feedback" with demographic and location variables, identifying patterns in order status and customer satisfaction. 

Examining of interactions between variables using correlation matrices, ensuring valuable data insights.
